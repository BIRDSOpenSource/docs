## *We make space sector capacity building accessible to everyone*


### *Introduction*

This introduction is an overview of the project, how it is organised, and how it works.


### *What is BIRDS-OSP?*

The BIRDS Open Source Project is a group of resources aimed at educational institutions and space agencies in emerging space faring nations interested in developing the capacity of their locality.

The aim is to get as many countries as possible into the space race.

BIRDS-OSP offers teaching guids, tutorials, and design, manufacturing and procedural documents to help you get a satellite into space.

BIRDS-OSP is free and transparent. The source files for all past flight heritage can be found on [Github].

BIRDS-OSP is an intiative of LaSiene, a labotaotry out of Kyushu Institute of Technology.
